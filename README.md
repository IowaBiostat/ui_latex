# UI Beamer/LaTeX slides 

Here is a template for creating [Beamer slides](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer) that are consistent with the University of Iowa [brand manual colors](https://brand.uiowa.edu/color). The PDF contains a minimal example. 

Some of my LaTeX shortcuts are included at the top of the `.tex` file -- these are specific to statistical notation. Of course, you could modify these however you'd like. 

Special thanks to my advisor [Patrick Breheny](https://github.com/pbreheny/pb-latex) and [Javi Flores](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KWz0HccAAAAJ&hl=en) for sharing their templates with me in years past. My template has taken some elements from both of theirs.
